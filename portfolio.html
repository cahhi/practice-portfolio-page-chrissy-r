    <h1>All about me!</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Chrissy Rodgers! I am currently a student at LaunchCode and I am learning Full Stack engineering. I have three older brothers and one is my twin named Chris (although he is older only by 15 minutes!). I live with my <em>beautiful and wonderful</em>who has been encouraging me on my coding journey. I enjoy reading books, playing video games, and just exploring around the city. I am also a very big traveler and foodie and love that I can do both at the same time. I have a life-long goal to visit every <b>Disney</b> resort in the world! I only have <em>Shanghai, China</em> and <em>Paris, France</em> and then I will have completed the goal! </p>
